/**
 *
 * This sample shows a simple example of pattern machine usage.
 *
 * Given an integer we are going to apply pattern machine to return some string values depending on the integer value.
 * If the integer is one we are going to return "one", if the integer is two we are going to return "two" else if
 * we are going to return "some other number".
 *
 * The "_" case is used as default.
